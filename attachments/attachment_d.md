# Attachment D - Minimum requirements for the use of an IRB approach { page 36, Attachment D }

1. The minimum requirements set out in this Attachment apply to all IRB exposures and the FIRB, AIRB, retail IRB and supervisory slotting approaches, unless stated otherwise. An ADI must ensure that the minimum requirements are met at the time of IRB approval by APRA and on an ongoing basis.

## Composition of minimum requirements

2. An ADI’s credit risk rating and associated risk estimation systems and processes must provide for a meaningful assessment of borrower and transaction characteristics, a meaningful differentiation and ranking of risk, and quantitative estimates of risk that are consistent, verifiable, relevant and soundly based. The internal ratings and quantitative risk estimates associated with those systems and processes must play an essential role in the ADI’s risk management and decision-making processes.

3. An ADI must adhere to the overall requirements for rating system design, operation, controls, governance and use as well as the requirements for the quantification and validation of PD estimates. An ADI that uses its own estimates of LGD and EAD must also meet the incremental minimum requirements relating to those risk components.

## Rating system design

4. Within each relevant IRB asset class, an ADI may utilise multiple rating methodologies or systems. If the ADI chooses to use multiple methodologies or systems, the rationale for assigning a borrower to a rating methodology or system must be documented and applied in a manner that best reflects the level of risk of the borrower. The ADI must not allocate borrowers across rating methodologies or systems for the primary purpose of minimising its capital requirement.

## Rating dimensions

### Requirements for corporate, sovereign and financial institution exposures

5. An internal rating system for corporate, sovereign and financial institution exposures must have two separate and distinct dimensions:
(a) the risk of borrower default (borrower grade); and
(b) transaction-specific factors (facility grade).

6. The borrower grade must be oriented to the risk of borrower default; that is, it must solely reflect PD. Subject to the exceptions set out in paragraph 7 of this Attachment, an ADI must assign the same borrower grade to separate exposures to the same borrower irrespective of any differences in the nature of each specific transaction.
---
# Requirements for retail exposures { page 37, Attachment D }

7. An ADI may assign different borrower grades to separate exposures to the same borrower in the following circumstances:
(a) in the case of country transfer risk, the ADI may assign different borrower grades depending on whether the facility is denominated in domestic or foreign currency; and
(b) where the treatment of associated guarantees or credit derivatives to a facility is reflected in an adjustment to the borrower grade.

8. A borrower grade must represent an assessment of borrower risk on the basis of a specified and distinct set of rating criteria from which estimates of PD are derived. An ADI’s credit policies must articulate the:
(a) relationship between borrower grades in terms of the level of credit risk each grade implies. Perceived and measured credit risk must increase as credit quality declines from one grade to the next; and
(b) credit risk of each borrower grade in terms of both a description of the default risk typical for borrowers assigned to the grade and the criteria used to distinguish that level of credit risk. Modifiers such as ‘+’ or ‘-’ to alpha or numeric borrower grades will only qualify as distinct grades if the ADI has developed complete rating descriptions and criteria for their assignment and separately quantifies PD estimates for those modified grades.

9. The facility grade must reflect transaction-specific factors such as collateral, seniority and product type; that is, it must solely reflect LGD. Borrower characteristics may be included as LGD rating criteria only to the extent that they are predictive of LGD. However, under the FIRB approach an ADI may satisfy this requirement by using a facility grade dimension that reflects both borrower and transaction-specific factors. The criteria used to define facility grades must be grounded in empirical evidence.

10. Specialised lending exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach are excluded from the two-dimensional rating requirement. In this case, an ADI may have a single rating dimension that reflects EL by incorporating both PD and LGD considerations.

11. Rating systems for retail exposures must be oriented to both borrower and transaction risks and capture all relevant borrower and transaction characteristics. An ADI must assign retail exposures into particular pools separately reflecting PD, LGD and EAD. The ADI must ensure that this process provides for a meaningful differentiation and ranking of risk, a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures, and accurate and consistent estimation of PD, LGD and EAD at the pool level. Different pools of retail exposures may share identical PD, LGD or EAD estimates.

12. At a minimum, an ADI must consider the following risk drivers when assigning retail exposures to a pool:
---
# Requirements for corporate, sovereign and financial institution exposures { page 38, Attachment D }

13. For each pool where an ADI estimates PD and LGD, it must analyse the representativeness of the age of facilities (in terms of the time since origination for PD and the time since default for LGD) in the data used to derive the estimates. The ADI must adjust its estimates upward to account for a lack of representativeness in the data as well as anticipated implications of rapid exposure growth that may lead to default rates peaking several years after origination.

14. An ADI must have a sufficient number of distinct rating grades to allow for a meaningful distribution of exposures, with no excessive concentrations in either its borrower grades or, where relevant, facility grades.

15. Subject to the exception set out in paragraph 17 of this Attachment, an ADI must have a minimum of seven borrower grades for non-defaulted borrowers and one for defaulted borrowers. An ADI with lending activities focused on a particular market segment may satisfy this requirement with the minimum number of grades. An ADI that lends to borrowers of diverse credit quality should have a greater number of borrower grades. Significant concentrations within a single borrower grade or grades must be supported by empirical evidence that the grade or grades cover reasonably narrow PD bands and that the default risk posed by borrowers in each grade fall within the relevant band.

16. There is no minimum number of facility grades for an ADI using the AIRB approach; however, the ADI must have a sufficient number of facility grades to avoid grouping facilities with widely varying LGD estimates into a single grade.

17. An ADI using the supervisory slotting approach for specialised lending exposures must have at least four rating grades for non-defaulted borrowers and one for defaulted borrowers.

# Requirements for retail exposures { page 38, Attachment D }

18. An ADI must be able to provide quantitative measures of PD, LGD and EAD for each identified pool of retail exposures. The level of differentiation must ensure that the number of exposures in a given pool is sufficient to allow for meaningful quantification and validation of PD, LGD and EAD estimates at the pool level.
---
# Rating criteria { page 39, Attachment D }

There must also be a meaningful distribution of exposures across pools, with no single pool comprising an undue concentration of exposures.

Requirements for all exposures

19. An ADI must have specific rating definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades or pools within a rating system. The rating definitions and criteria must be plausible, intuitive and result in a meaningful differentiation of risk.

20. An ADI’s internal rating descriptions and criteria must be sufficiently detailed to allow officers to consistently assign the same rating to borrowers and facilities posing similar risk, across lines of business, departments and geographic locations. If rating criteria and processes differ for different types of borrowers or facilities, the ADI must monitor for possible inconsistency in rating assignments and alter rating criteria and processes to improve consistency where appropriate.

21. Rating definitions must be sufficiently clear and detailed to allow independent third parties, including APRA, to understand the assignment of ratings, replicate rating assignments and evaluate the appropriateness of the assignment of exposures to grades or pools.

22. The rating criteria must be consistent with an ADI’s lending standards and its policies for managing borrowers and facilities that have deteriorated in credit quality.

23. An ADI must use all relevant, material and available information in assigning borrowers and facilities to grades or pools. The information used by the ADI must be current. The less information the ADI has, the more conservative it must be in assigning exposures to borrower and facility grades or pools. An external rating may be used as an input into the assignment process; however, the ADI must ensure that it considers all other relevant material information.

Additional requirements for specialised lending exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach

24. An ADI using the supervisory slotting approach must assign specialised lending exposures to its internal rating grades based on its own criteria, systems and processes. The ADI must also have a documented process that maps those internal rating grades into the slotting categories of strong, good, satisfactory, weak and default in a conservative and consistent manner. The ADI must ensure that its mapping process results in an alignment of grades that is consistent with the criteria defining the slotting categories as detailed in Attachment G to this Prudential Standard. The ADI must ensure that overrides of its internal criteria do not render the mapping process ineffective.
---
# Rating assignment horizon { page 40, Attachment D }

25. Although the time horizon required for PD estimation is one year,⁹ an ADI must use a longer time horizon when assigning borrowers to borrower grades or exposures to pools.

26. A borrower grade or pool must represent an ADI’s assessment of the borrower’s ability and willingness to perform contractually despite adverse economic conditions or the occurrence of unexpected events. The range of economic conditions that are considered when making assessments must be consistent with current conditions and those that are likely to occur over a business cycle within the respective industry or geographic region. Rating systems should be designed in such a way that idiosyncratic or industry-specific changes are a driver of migrations from one category to another, and business cycle effects may also be a driver.

27. An ADI’s PD estimates for hedge funds, other highly leveraged financial institutions or borrowers whose assets are predominantly traded assets must reflect the performance of the underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities. For this purpose, a highly leveraged financial institution means a financial institution that exhibits the following characteristics:
- (a) use of investment strategies that are intended to generate returns with low correlation to equity and bond indices, or that involve complex investment structures;
- (b) use of high leverage to increase returns;
- (c) use of derivatives for speculative purposes;
- (d) use of short selling; or
- (e) a material element of its fees is performance related.

28. Given the difficulties in forecasting future events and the influence that they could have on a particular borrower’s financial condition, an ADI must take a conservative view of projected information. Where limited data are available, the ADI must adopt a conservative bias in its analysis.

# Use of statistical models in the rating process { page 40, Attachment D }

29. The requirements in paragraphs 30 to 35 of this Attachment apply to statistical models and other mechanical methods used to assign borrower or facility grades or pools, and in the estimation of PD, LGD and EAD.

30. Credit scoring models and other mechanical methods are permissible as the primary or partial basis of rating assignments and may play a role in the estimation of PD, LGD and EAD under the IRB approach. However, human judgement and oversight must also be used to ensure that all relevant and material information, including that which is outside the scope of any such model or other.
---
# Documentation of rating system design { page 41, Attachment D }

31. Where an ADI uses a statistical model or other mechanical method in its rating process, the ADI must ensure that the model or other method has good predictive power and that the Regulatory Capital requirement will not be distorted as a result of its use. The variables that are used in the model or other method must form a reasonable set of predictors. On average, the model must be accurate across the range of borrowers or facilities to which the ADI is exposed. There must be no known material biases.

32. An ADI must have in place a process for vetting data inputs into a statistical model, which includes an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data specific to the assignment of a borrower or facility grade or pool.

33. An ADI must ensure that the data used to build its models are representative of the population of the ADI’s borrowers and facilities.

34. An ADI must have documented policies and procedures for reviewing model-based rating assignments. These policies and procedures must focus on finding and limiting errors associated with known model weaknesses. The ADI must make credible ongoing efforts to improve the model’s performance.

35. An ADI must undertake a regular cycle of model validation that includes monitoring model performance and stability, reviewing model relationships and testing model outputs against outcomes.

36. An ADI must document the design and operational details of its rating systems. Documentation must evidence the ADI’s compliance with minimum requirements and address:
- (a) portfolio differentiation;
- (b) rating criteria;
- (c) responsibilities of parties that assign ratings to borrowers and facilities;
- (d) the definition of what constitutes a rating override;
- (e) parties that have the authority to approve overrides;
- (f) frequency of rating reviews; and
- (g) management oversight of the rating process.

37. An ADI must document the rationale for its choice of internal rating criteria and must be able to provide analysis demonstrating that its rating criteria and procedures are likely to result in ratings that meaningfully differentiate risk.
---
# Rating system operations { page 42, Attachment D }

These rating criteria and procedures must be periodically reviewed to determine whether they remain fully applicable to the current portfolio and to external conditions.

38. An ADI must document the history of major changes in its credit risk rating process and such documentation must support identification of changes made to the rating process.

39. The organisation of rating assignment, including the internal control structure, must be documented.

40. An ADI must document the specific definitions of default and loss that are used internally and ensure consistency with the reference definitions set out in this Attachment.

41. Where an ADI employs statistical models in its rating process, it must document its methodologies. This documentation must include:
(a) a detailed outline of the theory, assumptions or mathematical and empirical basis of the assignment of estimates to grades, individual borrowers, exposures or pools, and the data sources used to estimate the model;
(b) details of the statistical process (including out-of-time and out-of-sample performance tests) for validating the model; and
(c) any circumstances under which the model does not work effectively.

42. Where an ADI uses a third-party vendor model, the ADI must still comply with all of the requirements detailed in this Attachment, irrespective of any claims of proprietary technology or information by the third-party vendor.

# Rating coverage { page 42, Attachment D }

43. For corporate, sovereign and financial institution exposures, each borrower and eligible guarantor or credit protection provider must be assigned a borrower grade and each exposure must be associated with a facility grade as part of the loan approval process. Similarly, for retail exposures, each exposure must be assigned to a pool as part of the loan approval process.

44. Each separate legal entity to which an ADI is exposed must be separately rated. The ADI must have documented policies regarding the treatment of individual entities in a connected group, including the circumstances under which the same rating may or may not be assigned to some or all related entities. Those policies must include a process to identify, monitor and control specific wrong-way risk for each legal entity to which the ADI is exposed.¹⁰

10 Specific wrong-way risk means the risk that arises when the exposure to a particular counterparty is positively correlated with the probability of default of the counterparty due to the nature of the transactions with the counterparty.
---
# Integrity of the rating process { page 43, Attachment D }

45. Rating assignments and periodic rating reviews must be completed or approved by a party that does not directly stand to benefit from the extension of credit. An ADI’s policies and procedures must document how independence of the rating assignment process is ensured.

46. The assignment of borrower and facility ratings must be reviewed and refreshed on at least an annual basis. Certain exposures, especially higher risk borrowers or problem exposures, must be subject to more frequent rating review. In addition, an ADI must initiate a new rating review when material information on the borrower or facility comes to light.

47. An ADI must have an effective process for obtaining and updating relevant and material information on the borrower’s financial condition and other characteristics that affect assigned estimates of PD, LGD and EAD. The ADI must also have a procedure for updating borrower and facility ratings in a timely fashion when relevant information is received.

# Requirements for retail exposures { page 43, Attachment D }

48. An ADI must review the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified pool on at least an annual basis. This must include a review of the status of individual borrowers within each pool as a means of ensuring that exposures continue to be assigned to the correct pool.

# Overrides { page 43, Attachment D }

49. For rating assignments based on expert judgement, an ADI must clearly document the situations in which officers may override the outputs of the rating process, including how and to what extent such overrides can be made and by whom.

50. For model-based ratings, an ADI must have guidelines and processes for monitoring cases where human judgement has overridden the model’s rating, variables that were excluded or inputs that were altered. Those guidelines must include identifying personnel who are responsible for approving such overrides.

51. An ADI must have systems that identify overrides and separately track their nature and performance.

# Data maintenance { page 43, Attachment D }

Requirements for all exposures

52. An ADI must collect and store data, including on key borrower and facility characteristics, of sufficient detail, scope, reliability and consistency to support its internal credit risk measurement and management processes, enable the ADI to meet the requirements of this Prudential Standard and serve as a basis for.
---
# Regulatory Reporting and Disclosure Requirements { page 44, Attachment D }

The data must be sufficiently detailed to facilitate ongoing improvements to the ADI’s rating systems and enable retrospective re-rating of borrowers and facilities when such improvements are envisaged.

53. Where an ADI sells a credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss, the ADI must:
(a) maintain an internal register of these credit obligations;
(b) consider the data contained in the register in its rating system design and validation processes. The subsequent inclusion in, or exclusion from, those processes of any data contained in the register must be justified by the ADI and must not result in lower LGD estimates; and
(c) ensure that the creation and use of data contained in the register is transparent to independent reviewers of the ADI’s rating systems, such as the ADI’s internal or external auditors and APRA.

Additional requirements for corporate, sovereign and financial institution exposures

54. An ADI must maintain rating histories of borrowers and eligible guarantors or credit protection providers, including initial and subsequent ratings, the dates that ratings were assigned, the methodology and key data used to derive ratings and the officer responsible for the most recent rating.

55. An ADI must retain data on PD estimates, rating migrations and realised default rates associated with borrower grades.

56. An ADI using the AIRB approach must maintain a history of data on LGD estimates associated with each facility, the methodology and key data used to derive LGD estimates, the officer responsible for the most recent rating, and realised LGD rates associated with each defaulted facility.

57. Where an ADI uses the AIRB approach and reflects the risk-mitigating effects of guarantees or credit derivatives through its LGD estimates, it must retain data on the LGD of the facility before and after evaluation of the effects of the guarantee or credit derivative.

58. For each defaulted exposure, an ADI must retain information about the identity of the borrower and facility, the timing and circumstances of the default, and the components of loss and recovery, including amounts and sources of recoveries (e.g. collateral, liquidation proceeds and guarantees or credit derivatives), timing of cash flows and administrative costs.

59. Where an ADI uses supervisory estimates for LGD or EAD, it must retain sufficient data to validate the supervisory estimates.

60. An ADI must retain data on realised losses for specialised lending exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach.
---
# Additional requirements for retail exposures { page 45, Attachment D }

61. An ADI must retain data used in the process of allocating retail exposures to pools. This includes data on borrower and transaction risk characteristics used either directly or through the use of a model as well as data on delinquency.

62. An ADI must retain data on PD, LGD and EAD estimates associated with its pools of retail exposures.

63. An ADI must retain data on loss rates in order to allow analysis of the volatility of loss rates for exposures in the QRR asset class compared to other types of retail lending.

64. For defaulted exposures, an ADI must retain data on the pools to which the retail exposure was assigned over the year prior to default and the realised outcomes on LGD and EAD.

# Stress tests in the assessment of capital adequacy { page 45, Attachment D }

65. An ADI must have sound stress testing processes in place for use in the assessment of its capital adequacy, including the sufficiency of the IRB capital requirement. Stress testing must include:
(a) the identification of possible events or severe changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on the ADI’s credit exposures; and
(b) an assessment of the ADI’s ability to withstand such events or changes.

66. An ADI must also perform one or more credit risk stress tests to assess the effect of certain conditions on its IRB capital requirement. For this purpose, the ADI must, at a minimum, consider the effect of mild recession scenarios. The stress tests must be meaningful and conservative.

# Use of internal ratings { page 45, Attachment D }

67. Internal ratings and PD, LGD and EAD estimates must play an integral role in the credit approval, risk management, internal capital allocation and governance functions of an ADI. Rating systems and estimates designed and implemented exclusively for the purpose of qualifying for an IRB approach and used only to provide IRB inputs are not acceptable.

68. Where there are differences between the credit risk estimates used by an ADI for Regulatory Capital and internal purposes, the ADI must:
(a) ensure that the data sources and methodologies utilised for determining its internal credit risk estimates are consistent with the estimates used to determine the Regulatory Capital requirement; and
(b) be able to justify, to APRA’s satisfaction, the reasonableness of those differences.
---
# Risk quantification { page 46, Attachment D }

Overall requirements for estimation

69. Internal estimates of PD, LGD and EAD must be reviewed on at least an annual basis and incorporate all relevant, material and available data and other information. In determining these estimates, an ADI may utilise internal data and relevant data from external sources (including pooled data).

70. Estimates must be grounded in historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on subjective considerations. Changes in an ADI’s lending and collection practices over the observation period must be taken into account. Estimates must be forward looking and responsive to changes in credit quality ahead of loss experience rather than lag such experience. The ADI’s estimates must reflect the implications of technical advances, new data and other information as it becomes available. Where industry estimation practices evolve and improve over time, the ADI should consider these developments in assessing its own practices.

71. In order to avoid over-optimism in PD, LGD and EAD estimates, an ADI must add a margin of conservatism to its estimates that reflects the likely range of errors. Where methods and data are less satisfactory and the likely range of errors is larger, the margin of conservatism must be larger.

Definition of default

72. An ADI must record actual defaults using the reference definition of default detailed in APS 220.¹¹ The ADI must also use the reference definition of default for the estimation of PD and, where relevant, LGD and EAD (though this does not preclude the possibility of materiality considerations entering into the estimation process). In arriving at its estimates, the ADI may use external data that are not consistent with the reference definition of default provided it makes appropriate adjustments to the data to achieve broad equivalence with the reference definition. This same requirement also applies to any internal data collected prior to 1 January 2008. Internal data (including that pooled by a number of ADIs) collected subsequent to 1 January 2008 must be consistent with the reference definition of default.

Re-aging

73. An ADI must have clearly documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due and, in particular, in respect of the re-aging of facilities and the granting of extensions, deferrals, renewals and rewrites to existing accounts. Where the ADI treats a re-aged exposure in a similar fashion to other exposures that are considered to be in default, that exposure must be recorded as defaulted for Regulatory Capital purposes.
---
# Risk quantification requirements specific to probability of default estimation { page 47, Attachment D }

Requirements for all exposures

74. An ADI must estimate PD for each internal borrower grade for corporate, sovereign and financial institution exposures and for each pool of retail exposures.¹²

75. PD estimates must be calibrated to a long-run average of one-year default rates (one-year PD) for borrowers in each borrower grade and for exposures in each pool.

76. An ADI must estimate PD for each borrower grade or pool based on the observed historical one-year default rate that is calculated as a simple average based on the number of borrowers or facilities (that is, count weighted). Weighting approaches such as EAD weighting are not permitted.

77. The length of the underlying historical observation period used for the estimation of PD must be at least five years for at least one data source. If the available observations from any source span a longer period, and the data are relevant, this longer period must be used. The data should include a representative mix of good and bad years of the economic cycle relevant for the portfolio.

Additional requirements for corporate, sovereign and financial institution exposures

78. When estimating PD for each borrower grade, an ADI must use information and techniques that take appropriate account of long-run experience. These techniques may include the use of internal default experience, mapping to external data and statistical models. The ADI may have a primary PD estimation technique and use other techniques as a point of comparison and potential adjustment. The mechanical application of a technique without supporting analysis is not sufficient. The ADI must recognise the importance of judgemental considerations in combining the results of techniques and in making adjustments for limitations of techniques and information.

Additional requirements for retail exposures

79. An ADI must use internal data as the primary source of information for estimating PD for retail exposures. The ADI may use other data sources for PD quantification provided a strong link can be demonstrated between its:
(a) process of assigning retail exposures to a pool and the process used by the other data source; and
(b) internal risk profile and the composition of the other data.

12 An ADI is not required to produce its own estimates of PD for specialised lending exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach.
---
# Risk quantification requirements specific to loss given default estimation { page 48, Attachment D }

Requirements for all exposures

80. An ADI must estimate LGD based on a measure of economic loss. The ADI must take into account all relevant factors when measuring economic loss including material discount effects and material direct and indirect costs associated with collecting on an exposure. The ADI must not simply measure the loss recorded in its accounting records for LGD purposes, although it must be able to reconcile accounting and economic loss.

81. An ADI may make adjustments to its LGD estimates to reflect its own workout and collection expertise. Such adjustments must be supported by sufficient internal empirical evidence.

82. LGD estimates must take into account additional drawings after the time of default.

83. LGD estimates must reflect economic downturn conditions. That is, an ADI must take into account the potential for LGD to be higher than average during a period when defaults or credit losses are substantially higher than average.

84. Where loss severities do not exhibit cyclical variability, LGD estimates must not be less than the long-run default-weighted average LGD calculated as the average loss of all observed defaults within a data source for that type of exposure.

85. LGD estimates must be grounded in historical recovery rates and, where applicable, must not be based solely on the estimated market value of collateral.

86. To the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, an ADI must establish internal requirements for collateral management, operational procedures, legal certainty and risk management processes that are consistent with those detailed in Attachment G to APS 112 and Attachment E to this Prudential Standard.

87. For LGD estimation purposes, an ADI must consider the extent of any dependence between the risk of the borrower and that of the collateral or collateral provider. Cases where there is a significant degree of dependence must be addressed in a conservative manner. Currency mismatches between the underlying obligation and the collateral must also be considered and treated conservatively in the ADI’s assessment of LGD.

Additional requirements for corporate exposures

88. Estimates of LGD for corporate exposures must be based on a minimum data observation period that should ideally cover at least one complete economic cycle but, in any case, must be no shorter than a period of seven years from at least one source. If the available observation period spans a longer period from any source and the data are relevant and material, this longer period must be used.
---
# Additional requirements for retail exposures { page 49, Attachment D }

89. The minimum data observation period for LGD estimates for retail exposures is five years from at least one data source. If the available observation period spans a longer period from any source and the data are relevant and material, this longer period must be used. The less data an ADI has, the more conservative it must be in its estimation of LGD.

# Additional requirements for defaulted exposures { page 49, Attachment D }

90. The LGD assigned to a defaulted exposure must reflect the possibility that an ADI may have to recognise additional UL during the recovery period.

# Risk quantification requirements specific to exposure at default estimation { page 49, Attachment D }

## Requirements for revolving retail exposures { page 49, Attachment D }

91. An ADI must have procedures in place for the estimation of EAD for its off-balance sheet exposures. Estimates of EAD must reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the borrower up to the time a default event is triggered. However, additional drawings after the time of default must not be reflected in EAD and must instead be included in LGD. Where estimates of EAD differ by facility type, the delineation of these facilities must be clear and unambiguous.

92. An ADI must assign an estimate of EAD for each facility. EAD must be an estimate of the long-run default-weighted average EAD for similar facilities and borrowers over a sufficiently long period of time, with a margin of conservatism appropriate to the likely range of errors in the estimate. If a positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default frequency and the magnitude of EAD, the EAD estimate must incorporate a larger margin of conservatism.

93. For exposures where EAD estimates are volatile over the economic cycle, an ADI must use EAD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if these are more conservative than the long-run default-weighted average.

94. The criteria by which estimates of EAD are derived must be plausible, intuitive and represent what an ADI believes to be the material drivers of EAD. The criteria must be supported by credible internal analysis by the ADI. The ADI must be able to provide a breakdown of its EAD experience by the factors it sees as the drivers of EAD. The ADI must use all relevant and material information in its determination of EAD estimates.

95. An ADI’s EAD estimates must give due consideration to its policies and procedures in respect of account monitoring and payment processing. The ADI must consider its ability and willingness to prevent further drawings in circumstances short of payment default, such as covenant violations or other technical default events.

96. An ADI must have systems and procedures in place to monitor, on a daily basis, facility amounts, outstanding amounts against committed lines and changes in outstanding amounts for each borrower and borrower grade or pool.
---


97. An ADI’s EAD estimates must be developed using a one-year fixed-horizon approach; that is, for each observation in the reference dataset, default outcomes must be linked to relevant borrower and facility characteristics one year prior to default.

98. An ADI’s EAD estimates must be based on reference data that reflect the borrower, facility and ADI management practice characteristics of the exposures to which the estimates are applied. EAD estimates applied to particular exposures must not be based on data that co-mingle the effects of disparate characteristics or data from exposures that exhibit different characteristics. EAD estimates must be based on appropriately homogenous segments or an estimation approach that disentangles effectively the impact of the different characteristics exhibited within the relevant dataset.

99. Where an ADI estimates CCFs directly, it must ensure that those estimates are quarantined effectively from the potential effects of the region of instability associated with facilities that are close to being fully drawn at the reference date.

100. EAD reference data must not be capped at the principal amount outstanding or facility limits. Accrued interest, other due payments and limit excesses must be included in EAD reference data.

101. The minimum data observation period for EAD estimation is five years from at least one data source. If the available observation period spans a longer period from any source and the data are relevant and material, this longer period must be used. The less data an ADI has, the more conservative it must be in its estimation of EAD.

# Risk quantification requirements specific to expected loss { page 50, Attachment D }

102. For each defaulted exposure, an ADI using the AIRB or retail IRB approach must construct its best estimate of EL for that exposure based on current economic circumstances and the facility’s status. The mechanical application of a long-run average or downturn LGD estimate is not acceptable for this purpose. Instances where the best estimate of EL on a defaulted exposure is less than the sum of provisions and partial write-offs on that exposure must be justified to APRA by the ADI.

# Validation of Internal Estimates { page 50, Attachment D }

103. An ADI must have a robust and documented system in place to validate the accuracy and consistency of rating systems, processes and the estimation of all relevant credit risk components. The ADI must ensure that the internal validation process enables it to assess the performance of its internal rating and credit risk estimation systems in a meaningful and consistent manner.

104. Validation must be undertaken at least annually by personnel that are independent of those responsible for the development of an ADI’s rating systems and risk estimates.


105. An ADI must regularly compare realised default rates with PD estimates for each borrower grade or pool and ensure that the realised default rates are within the expected range for each grade or pool. An ADI using its own LGD and EAD estimates must also complete such analysis for those estimates. Comparisons must make use of historical data over as long a time period as possible. The methods and data used in these comparisons must be clearly documented. This analysis and documentation must be updated at least annually.

106. An ADI must also use other quantitative validation tools and comparisons with relevant external data sources. The analysis must be based on data that are appropriate to the portfolio, updated regularly and cover a relevant observation period. The ADI’s internal assessment of the performance of its rating systems must be based on long data histories covering a range of economic conditions and, ideally, one or more complete business cycles.

107. An ADI must ensure that quantitative testing methods and other validation methods do not vary systematically with the economic cycle. Changes in methods and data (both data sources and periods covered) must be clearly and thoroughly documented.

108. An ADI must have documented internal standards for situations where deviations from expectations in realised PD rates and, where applicable, LGD and EAD rates, become significant enough to call the validity of the estimates into question. These standards must take account of business cycles and similar systematic variability in default experience. Where realised values continue to be higher than expected values, the ADI must revise its estimates upward to reflect its actual default and loss experience.

109. An ADI that uses supervisory, rather than internal, estimates of LGD and EAD must compare realised LGD and EAD rates to those set by APRA and use this information in its internal assessment of capital adequacy. The ADI must also complete such analysis in relation to EAD for arrangements that are excluded from the definition of a commitment under paragraph 3 of Attachment C to APS 112.
