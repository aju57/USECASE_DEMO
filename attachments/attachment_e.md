# Attachment E - Requirements for recognition of collateral and credit risk mitigation { page 52, Attachment E }

Eligible collateral under the FIRB approach
1. Where an ADI uses the FIRB approach, only the following may be recognised as eligible collateral:
(a) financial collateral;
(b) financial receivables;
(c) commercial real estate and residential real estate; and
(d) other physical collateral.

Eligible financial collateral
2. Eligible financial collateral is collateral that meets the minimum requirements detailed in Attachment G to APS 112.

Eligible financial receivables
3. Eligible financial receivables are exposures with an original maturity of one year or less, where repayment occurs through the commercial or financial flows related to the borrower’s underlying business operations. This includes:
(a) self-liquidating debt arising from the sale of goods or services linked to a commercial transaction; and
(b) general amounts owed by buyers, suppliers, renters, national and local government authorities or other non-affiliated parties that are not related to the sale of goods or services linked to a commercial transaction.
Receivables from affiliates of the borrower (including subsidiaries and employees) and receivables associated with securitisations, sub-participations and credit derivatives must not be recognised as eligible financial receivables.

4. An ADI may recognise financial receivables as eligible collateral where the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) the ADI has a perfected first priority security interest in the collateral which is legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. The ADI’s procedures must ensure that any legal conditions required for declaring the default of the customer are observed, and the ADI must be able to realise the collateral within a reasonable timeframe. In the event of the borrower’s financial distress or default, the ADI must have the legal authority to sell or assign the receivables to other parties without the consent of the receivables’ obligors;

# Eligible commercial or residential real estate { page 53, Attachment E }

5. An ADI may recognise commercial real estate and residential real estate collateral where the following requirements are met:

(a) the risk of the borrower defaulting is not materially dependent upon the performance or cash flow of the underlying real estate asset or project but rather on the underlying capacity of the borrower to repay the credit obligation from other sources;
(b) the value of the collateral is not materially dependent upon the performance of the borrower. This requirement is not intended to preclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both the value of the collateral and the performance of the borrower;
(c) claims on the collateral are legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions and legal requirements for establishing the ADI’s claim are fulfilled. The collateral agreement and the legal process underpinning the transaction must allow the ADI to realise the value of the collateral within a reasonable timeframe;
(d) the collateral is valued at no more than the current fair value under which it could be sold under contract between a willing seller and an independent buyer on the date of valuation;
(e) the ADI monitors the value of the collateral on at least an annual basis. More frequent monitoring is required where the market is subject to significant changes in value;

(f) the ADI’s lending policies clearly document the types of commercial real estate and residential real estate collateral that are acceptable to the ADI. Exceptions to, or overrides of, the ADI’s policy must not be recognised as eligible commercial real estate and residential real estate collateral;
(g) the ADI ensures that the real estate asset taken as collateral is adequately insured;
(h) the ADI monitors and takes into account prior claims (e.g. taxation liabilities) on the real estate asset; and
(i) the ADI monitors the risk of environmental liability arising in respect of the collateral.

Junior liens over commercial real estate or residential real estate may be taken into account where there is no doubt that the claim for collateral is legally enforceable and constitutes effective credit risk mitigation.

6. An ADI may recognise IPRE that falls under the specialised lending asset class as eligible collateral where:
(a) markets are well-developed and long-established;
(b) losses stemming from lower risk IPRE lending (defined as exposures up to the lower of 50 per cent of the market value or 60 per cent of the lending value) are less than 0.3 per cent of outstanding IPRE exposures in each of the past three years;
(c) overall losses stemming from IPRE lending are less than 0.5 per cent of outstanding IPRE exposures in each of the past three years;
(d) the ADI publicly discloses how it has satisfied the conditions in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c); and
(e) the conditions detailed in sub-paragraphs 5(c) to 5(i) of this Attachment are also satisfied.

If the ADI is unable to satisfy these requirements, it must immediately cease to recognise IPRE as eligible collateral.

# Other eligible physical collateral { page 54, Attachment E }
7. An ADI may recognise other physical collateral where the following conditions are met:
(a) the ADI is able to demonstrate the existence of liquid markets for the disposal of collateral in an expeditious and economically efficient manner. The ADI must assess that this condition is being met both periodically and when information indicates material changes in the market;
(b) the ADI is able to demonstrate that there are well established, publicly available market prices for the collateral. For this purpose, publicly available market prices may include valuations from independent third-party appraisers that are available for purchase and reflect the current state of the market. The ADI must also be able to demonstrate that the amount it will receive when collateral is realised does not deviate significantly from these market prices;

(c) the ADI must have a perfected security interest in the collateral, such that it has priority over all other lenders to the realised proceeds of the collateral. The security interest must be legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions, and the ADI must be able to realise the value of the collateral within a reasonable timeframe;

(d) the facility agreement must include detailed descriptions of the collateral and the right to examine and revalue the collateral at the sole discretion of the ADI;

(e) the collateral is valued at no more than the current fair value under which it could be sold under contract between a willing seller and an independent buyer on the date of valuation;

(f) the ADI monitors the value of the collateral on at least an annual basis. More frequent monitoring is required where the market is subject to significant changes in value;

(g) the ADI must have the right to physically inspect the collateral and have policies and procedures in place that set out the minimum frequency of inspection (physical or otherwise) for different types of collateral and the circumstances in which an inspection (physical or otherwise) of the collateral must be performed immediately;

(h) the ADI must have clearly documented credit policies and procedures that detail the:
(i) types of physical collateral accepted by the ADI, and policies and practices in respect of the appropriate amount of each type of collateral relative to the exposure amount;
(ii) ADI’s ability to liquidate the collateral readily; and
(iii) ADI’s ability to objectively establish a price or market value of the collateral, frequency with which the value can be readily obtained, and the volatility of the value of the collateral. The periodic revaluation process must pay particular attention to ‘fashion-sensitive’ collateral to ensure that valuations are appropriately adjusted downward for fashion, or model-year, obsolescence as well as physical obsolescence or deterioration;

(i) the ADI ensures that the collateral is adequately insured; and

(j) the ADI monitors the risk of environmental liability arising in respect of the collateral.


8. An ADI must have clearly documented policies and procedures for assessing each type of physical collateral against the conditions detailed in paragraph 7 of this Attachment. For this purpose, the ADI must consider:
(a) in relation to sub-paragraph 7(a) of this Attachment, the attributes of the collateral such as the degree of customisation or standardisation, location of the market in which the collateral is expected to be exchanged, age, condition and reusability of the collateral, transaction costs (including the time to transaction), and the prevalence of brokers and dealers; and
(b) where applicable, in relation to sub-paragraph 7(b) of this Attachment, the credibility of the appraiser and the reliability of their appraisals.

9. An ADI must maintain a register of physical collateral deemed to be eligible collateral based on an assessment against the conditions detailed in paragraph 7 of this Attachment. The register must be kept up-to-date and made available to APRA upon request.

# General security agreements { page 56, Attachment E }
10. Where an ADI’s exposure is secured by a general security agreement (or an equivalent form of floating charge) over both eligible collateral and other types of collateral, it may only recognise the security interest over eligible collateral. Recognition is conditional on the eligible collateral meeting the relevant operational requirements detailed in this Attachment.

# Recognition of leasing { page 56, Attachment E }
11. In addition to the minimum requirements for the eligible collateral type, an ADI must also satisfy the following requirements in relation to its lease exposures:
(a) robust risk management practices with respect to the location of the leased asset, its use, age and planned obsolescence;
(b) a robust legal framework establishing the ADI’s legal ownership of the leased asset and its ability to exercise its rights as owner in a timely manner; and
(c) the difference between the rate of depreciation of the leased asset and the rate of amortisation of the lease payments must not be so large as to overstate the credit risk mitigation effect of the leased asset.

# Recognition of guarantees and credit derivatives { page 56, Attachment E }

12. In order to recognise the use of CRM techniques to reduce Regulatory Capital requirements, all documentation that supports the use of the CRM technique must be binding on all parties and legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. An ADI must have undertaken sufficient legal review to be satisfied of the legal enforceability of the CRM technique, and must undertake periodic reviews to confirm its ongoing enforceability.


13. All recognised guarantors and credit protection providers must be assigned a borrower rating at the outset and on an ongoing basis. An ADI must follow the minimum requirements for assigning borrower ratings as set out in Attachment D to this Prudential Standard. The ADI must undertake regular monitoring of the financial condition of the guarantor or credit protection provider, and its ability and willingness to honour its obligations.

14. An ADI must have documented criteria for adjusting PD or LGD estimates to reflect the impact of guarantees and credit derivatives under the substitution approaches. These criteria must:
(a) be consistent with the requirements for assigning exposures to borrower or facility grades or pools as set out in paragraphs 19 to 23 of Attachment D to this Prudential Standard;
(b) be plausible and intuitive, and address the guarantor or credit protection provider’s ability and willingness to perform under the guarantee or credit derivative;
(c) address the likely timing of any payments and the degree to which the guarantor or credit protection provider’s ability to perform under the guarantee or credit derivative is correlated with the borrower’s ability to repay; and
(d) consider the extent to which residual risks remain.

15. The criteria used for adjusting PD or LGD estimates for exposures covered by credit derivatives must also:
(a) require that the asset on which the protection is based (the reference asset) not be different from the underlying asset unless the conditions detailed in paragraphs 10 and 11 of Attachment J to APS 112 are met; and
(b) address the payout structure of the credit derivative and conservatively assess the impact this has on the level and timing of recoveries. Where a credit derivative does not cover the restructuring of the underlying asset, partial recognition is allowed as detailed in paragraph 9 of Attachment J to APS 112.

16. In adjusting PD or LGD estimates to reflect the impact of guarantees and credit derivatives, an ADI must take all relevant, material information into account.

17. An ADI must retain all relevant information on the assignment of an exposure to a borrower or facility grade or pool, and the estimation of PD and LGD, independently of the assessed effect of the guarantee or credit derivative.
---
# FIRB approach { page 57, Attachment E }
18. For exposures subject to the FIRB approach, an ADI must meet the requirements 
detailed in Attachment I to APS 112 to recognise a guarantee as eligible CRM. In addition to the eligible guarantors detailed in APS 112, the ADI may also 
recognise borrowers that are internally rated as eligible guarantors.


19. For exposures subject to the FIRB approach, an ADI must meet the requirements detailed in Attachment J to APS 112 to recognise credit derivatives as eligible CRM.

# AIRB or retail IRB approach { page 58, Attachment E }

20. For exposures subject to the AIRB or retail IRB approach, an ADI is not limited in its recognition of eligible guarantors or credit protection providers provided it has clearly documented criteria for the types of guarantors or credit protection providers it will recognise for Regulatory Capital purposes. Additionally, the guarantee or credit derivative must be:
- (a) evidenced in writing;
- (b) non-cancellable on the part of the guarantor or credit protection provider;
- (c) in force until the obligation is satisfied in full (to the extent of the amount and tenor of the guarantee or credit derivative); and
- (d) unconditional, such that it does not include any clauses that are outside the direct control of the ADI, or that could prevent the guarantor or credit protection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the borrower fails to make the payment(s) due. However, the ADI may recognise guarantees or credit derivatives that only cover the loss remaining after the ADI has first pursued the borrower for payment and has completed the workout process.

21. For exposures subject to the AIRB or retail IRB approach, an ADI may recognise the risk mitigating effects of first-to-default credit derivatives but must not recognise second-to-default or nth-to-default credit derivatives.
