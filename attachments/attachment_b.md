# Attachment B - Risk components for each asset class { page 22, Attachment B }

1. An ADI must calculate the risk components PD, LGD, EAD and M in accordance with the requirements detailed in this Attachment. An ADI that uses its own PD, LGD and EAD estimates for Regulatory Capital purposes must also meet the minimum requirements detailed in Attachment D to this Prudential Standard.

2. Where an exposure is guaranteed by a sovereign, and the guarantee meets the requirements set out in Attachment E to this Prudential Standard, the floors that apply to the risk components do not apply to the portion of the exposure that is covered by the sovereign guarantee.

## Probability of default estimates

3. Subject to the exceptions set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Attachment, PD is the greater of the PD estimate associated with the internal borrower grade or pool to which an exposure is assigned and 0.05 per cent.

4. For QRR exposures, PD is the greater of:
- (a) the PD estimate associated with the internal borrower grade or pool to which an exposure is assigned; and
- (b) 0.1 per cent for QRR revolvers or 0.05 per cent for QRR transactors.

5. For sovereign exposures, PD is the PD estimate associated with the internal borrower grade to which an exposure is assigned.

6. An ADI must assign a 100 per cent PD to defaulted exposures.

## Loss given default estimates

7. LGD estimates must be measured as a percentage of EAD.

### Senior unsecured exposures and senior exposures secured by ineligible collateral under the FIRB approach

8. Subject to the exceptions set out in paragraphs 9 to 11 of this Attachment, an ADI that uses the FIRB approach must assign a 50 per cent LGD to all senior exposures that are not secured by eligible collateral. For this purpose, eligible collateral is collateral that meets the minimum requirements detailed in Attachment E to this Prudential Standard.

9. Where an ADI uses the FIRB approach, it may assign lower LGD estimates to eligible senior exposures to sovereign counterparties, which are not secured by eligible collateral, using the ratings of external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs). Where the ECAI is S&P Global Ratings, Moody‚Äôs or Fitch Ratings, ratings and the relevant LGD must be mapped in accordance with Table 3. Where a sovereign exposure has multiple ECAI ratings that correspond to multiple credit rating grades, the ADI must apply the requirements detailed in paragraph 6 of this Prudential Standard.

The ADI must apply the due diligence requirements in Attachment F of APS 112 when using the ratings of ECAIs.

## Table 3: LGD estimates for eligible sovereign exposures

| S&P Global Ratings | Moody‚Äôs | Fitch Ratings | LGD (%) |
|--------------------|---------|---------------|---------|
| AAA | Aaa | AAA | |
| AA+ | Aa1 | AA+ | 5 |

| AA- | Aa3 | AA- | |
| A+ | A1 | A+ | |
| A | A2 | A | 25 |

Unrated exposure to an Australian local council.

10. Where an ADI uses the FIRB approach, it may assign a 25 per cent LGD to senior exposures to operators of domestic large public infrastructure assets or utilities that:
- (a) provide essential services to the economy; and
- (b) have tripartite arrangements with the Commonwealth Australian Government or an Australian State or Territory government, or are valued based on regulatory asset base, an ADI that uses the FIRB approach may assign a:
- (c) 40 per cent LGD where the operator is a corporate counterparty; or
- (d) 45 per cent LGD where the operator is a sovereign counterparty that is not eligible for the LGD treatment specified in Table 3 or is a financial institution.

10.11. Where an ADI applies the FIRB approach, it may use the supervisory LGD estimates and collateral haircuts detailed in Table 4 as inputs to the LGD calculation for senior exposures that are not secured by eligible collateral but have eligible recovery value. The LGD must be calculated in accordance with the methodology detailed in paragraphs 16 to 18 of this Attachment, where the LGD for the secured portion (LGDSi) is as specified in Table 4 and the LGD for the unsecured portion (LGDU) is as specified in paragraph 8 of this Attachment.

# Supervisory LGD estimates and collateral haircuts for exposures with eligible recovery value { page 24, Attachment B }

| Supervisory category | LGD (%) | HC (%) |
|----------------------|---------|--------|
| Physical collateral that does not meet the minimum requirements detailed in Attachment E to this Prudential Standard | Corporate: 40 | |
| | Sovereign or financial institution: 45 | |

# Senior unsecured exposures under the AIRB approach { page 24, Attachment B }

11.12. An ADI that uses the AIRB approach must apply a 50 per cent LGD to all senior unsecured exposures, except in the case of senior exposures to operators of domestic large public infrastructure assets or utilities that meet the requirements detailed in paragraph 10 of this Attachment where the ADI may apply a 25 per cent LGD. For this purpose, the ADI must have a documented policy that details its definition of a senior unsecured exposure.

# Subordinated debt { page 24, Attachment B }

12.13. An ADI must assign a 75 per cent LGD to all subordinated debt, aside from junior liens over commercial real estate or residential real estate that meet the eligibility criteria for recognition as eligible collateral as specified in Attachment E to this Prudential Standard. The ADI must have a documented policy that details its definition of subordination. At a minimum, the definition must include any facility that is expressly subordinated to another facility and also address economic subordination.

# Exposures secured by eligible collateral under the FIRB approach { page 24, Attachment B }

13.14. Where an ADI applies the FIRB approach, it must use the supervisory LGD estimates and collateral haircuts detailed in Table 5 as inputs to the LGD calculation for exposures secured by eligible collateral.

| Supervisory category | LGD (%) | HC (%) |
|----------------------|---------|--------|
| Eligible financial collateral | 0 | 40 |
| Eligible receivables | 20 | 40 |
| Eligible residential real estate or commercial real estate | 20 | 40 |
| Other eligible physical collateral | 25 | 40 |
---
# Methodology for recognition of eligible collateral { page 25, Attachment B }

14.15. For eligible financial collateral, an ADI must apply the haircuts calculated under the comprehensive approach as set out in Attachment G to APS 112. These haircuts must be adjusted for different holding periods and non-daily remargining or revaluation as detailed in that Attachment.

15.16. Where an ADI uses the FIRB approach, the LGD applicable to a collateralised transaction must be calculated as the exposure-weighted average of the LGD for the unsecured portion (LGDU) and the LGD for the collateralised portion (LGDSi). Specifically:
ùêøùê∫ùê∑ = ùêøùê∫ùê∑‡Øé √ó ùê∏‡Øé + ‚àë ùêøùê∫ùê∑‡Øå‡Øú √ó ùê∏‡Øå‡Øú
ùê∏ √ó (1 + ùêª‡Ææ)

where:
E is the current value of the exposure (i.e. cash lent or securities lent or posted) committed amount. In the case of securities lent or posted, the exposure value must be increased by applying the appropriate haircuts (HE) according to the comprehensive approach for the recognition of financial collateral as detailed in Attachment G to APS 112.
ESi is the current value of the collateral after applying the appropriate haircuts for the type of collateral (HC) and for any currency mismatch between the exposure and the collateral. The sum of ESi across all collateral types must be capped at the value of ùê∏ √ó (1 + ùêª‡Ææ).
For the purpose of determining ESi for an exposure with a junior lien, the ADI must apply the appropriate haircuts to the value of the collateral and then reduce it by the sum of all exposures with liens that rank higher than the junior liens. In cases where liens are held by third parties that rank pari passu with the lien of the ADI, only the proportion of the value of the collateral (after the application of haircuts and reductions due to exposures with liens that rank higher than the lien of the ADI) that is attributable to the ADI may be recognised.
ùê∏‡Øé = ùê∏ √ó (1 + ùêª‡Ææ) ‚àí ‚àë ùê∏‡Øå‡Øú. The terms EU and ESi are only used to calculate the LGD applicable to the collateralised transaction. The ADI must continue to calculate EAD without taking into account the presence of any collateral, unless specified otherwise.
LGDU is the LGD applicable to an unsecured exposure as set out in paragraphs 8 to 10 and 13 of this Attachment.
LGDSi is the LGD applicable to an exposure secured by that type of collateral as set out in paragraphs 11 and 14 of this Attachment.

16.17. Where eligible collateral is denominated in a different currency to that of the exposure, an ADI must apply a haircut for currency risk (Hfx) in accordance.
---
# Corporate exposures under the AIRB approach { page 26, Attachment B }

17.18. For the purpose of calculating the LGD applicable to a sovereign exposure that is secured by eligible collateral, where applicable, an ADI is permitted to adopt the lower of the:
- (a) relevant LGD specified in paragraph 9 of this Attachment; and
- (b) LGD determined in accordance with paragraph 16 to 17 of this Attachment.

18.19. For corporate exposures subject to the AIRB approach, the LGD for each secured or partially secured exposure that is used as an input to the risk-weight function and the calculation of EL must not be less than the floors detailed in Table 6. However, the floor does not apply to the best estimate of EL for defaulted exposures.

| Collateral type | LGD (%) |
|------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Secured | |
| Financial collateral | 0 |
| Receivables | 10 |
| Commercial or residential real estate | 10 |
| Other physical collateral | 15 |
| All other collateral | 25 |
| Unsecured | 25 |

19.20. The LGD floors for secured exposures specified in Table 6 must be applied where an exposure is fully secured (i.e. the value of collateral after applying the haircuts specified in Table 5 exceeds the value of the exposure).

20.21. The LGD floor for a partially secured exposure must be calculated as the exposure-weighted average of the LGD floor for the unsecured portion and the LGD floor for the secured portion. The following formula must be used for this purpose:

\[
\text{LGD floor} = \text{LGD}_{\text{secured}} \times \frac{E}{E + H} + \sum \text{LGD}_{\text{unsecured}} \times \frac{E}{E + H}
\]

# Retail exposures { page 27, Attachment B }

21.22. For retail exposures, the LGD for each exposure that is used as an input to the risk-weight function and the calculation of EL must not be less than the floors detailed in Table 7. However, the floor does not apply to the best estimate of EL for defaulted exposures.

Table 7 LGD floors for retail exposures

| Exposure type | LGD (%) |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Retail residential mortgage | 10 |
| Other secured | |
| Financial collateral | 0 |
| Receivables | 10 |
| Commercial or residential real estate | 10 |
| Other physical collateral | 15 |
| All other collateral | 30 |
| Unsecured | |
| QRR | 50 |
| All other unsecured | 30 |

22.23. The LGD floors for secured exposures specified in Table 7 must be applied where an exposure is fully secured (i.e. the value of collateral after applying the haircuts specified in Table 5 exceeds the value of the exposure).

23.24. The LGD floor for a partially secured retail exposure must be calculated according to the formula set out in paragraph 21 of this Attachment, aside from the LGD floor for a retail residential mortgage exposure, which is fixed irrespective of the level of collateral provided.

24.25. An ADI that has approval to use its own estimates of LGD for retail residential mortgage exposures must not take into account recoveries from LMI when deriving those LGD estimates. The ADI may instead recognise the risk-mitigating effect of LMI by applying a 20 per cent reduction to its LGD estimates (subject to the floor specified in Table 7) for exposures with a loan-to-valuation ratio, as defined in APS 112, of greater than 80 per cent that have LMI cover.

25.26. An ADI that is not approved to use its own estimates of LGD for retail residential mortgage exposures or SME retail exposures secured by residential.

# Exposure at default estimates { page 28, Attachment B }

26.27. EAD in respect of each exposure (both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet) must be measured without deducting any provisions for, and partial write-offs of, that exposure.

# On-balance sheet exposures { page 28, Attachment B }

27.28. Subject to paragraph 31 of this Attachment, EAD for a drawn amount (i.e. an on-balance sheet exposure) must not be less than the current contractual amount owed by the borrower nor should it be less than the sum of:
- (a) the amount by which an ADI‚Äôs Common Equity Tier 1 Capital would be reduced if the exposure were fully written-off; and
- (b) any associated provisions and partial write-offs.

28.29. When the difference between EAD and the sum of the amounts specified in paragraphs 28(a) and 28(b) of this Attachment is positive, this amount is termed a discount. An ADI must not take into account such discounts when calculating RWA. Such discounts may be included in the measurement of eligible provisions for the purpose of offsetting EL in calculating the ADI‚Äôs Regulatory Capital requirement in accordance with Attachment C to this Prudential Standard.

29.30. Defaulted exposures purchased by an ADI are not subject to the floor specified in paragraph 28 of this Attachment. For those exposures, EAD must be based on the exposure‚Äôs carrying value and the discount must be set equal to zero.

30.31. An ADI may recognise on-balance sheet netting of assets and liabilities where it meets the criteria detailed in Attachment H to APS 112. Where there is a currency or maturity mismatch between the relevant assets and liabilities, adjustments must be made in accordance with the treatment set out in APS 112.

# Off-balance sheet exposures except those that expose an ADI to counterparty credit risk { page 28, Attachment B }

31.32. Where an ADI uses:
- (a) supervisory estimates of EAD, EAD for an undrawn commitment is calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF; and
- (b) its own estimates of EAD, EAD for an undrawn commitment may be calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF or derived from a direct estimate of the total facility EAD.

32.33. Except in the case of retail exposures, CCFs may be applied to the lower of the value of the unused committed credit line and the value of any other constraining factor on the availability of the facility, such as the existence of a ceiling on the potential lending amount that is related to a borrower‚Äôs reported.
---
# Off-balance sheet exposures { page 29, Attachment B }

33.34. Where an ADI has given a commitment to provide an off-balance sheet exposure, it may apply the lower of the CCFs applicable to the commitment and the off-balance sheet exposure.

34.35. An ADI must apply the CCFs as specified in Attachment C to APS 112 when calculating EAD, with the exception of:
- (a) non-revolving retail exposures categorised as other commitments in accordance with Attachment C to APS 112, for which the CCF is 100 per cent; and
- (b) revolving retail exposures, excluding exposures subject to a CCF of 100 per cent in Attachment C to APS 112, for which the ADI may use its own estimates of EAD.

35.36. When only the drawn balances of revolving facilities have been securitised, an ADI must ensure that it continues to hold capital against the undrawn balances associated with the securitised exposure.

# Revolving retail exposures { page 29, Attachment B }

36.37. Where an ADI uses its own estimates of EAD for revolving retail exposures, EAD for each exposure that is used as an input to the risk-weight function and the calculation of EL must not be less than the sum of:
- (a) the on-balance sheet amount; and
- (b) 50 per cent of the off-balance sheet exposure using the applicable CCF in Attachment C to APS 112.

37.38. To the extent that foreign exchange and interest rate commitments exist within an ADI‚Äôs retail IRB asset class, the ADI is not permitted to use its internal estimates of EAD for those commitments and must instead apply the CCFs as specified in Attachment C to APS 112.

# Off-balance sheet exposures that expose an ADI to counterparty credit risk { page 29, Attachment B }

38.39. For off-balance sheet exposures that expose an ADI to counterparty credit risk, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives (as defined in APS 112), exchange-traded derivatives, and long settlement transactions, the ADI must calculate EAD according to the requirements set out in APS 180.

# Effective maturity { page 29, Attachment B }

39.40. For corporate, sovereign and financial institution exposures, an ADI must calculate M for each facility. Subject to paragraph 42 of this Attachment, M is the...
---
# Exceptions to the one-year maturity floor { page 30, Attachment B }

40.41. For an exposure subject to a specified cash flow schedule, M is defined as:
·µó CF
t
M t
CF
t
t
where:
CF‚Çú denotes the cash flows contractually payable by the borrower in period t
and t is expressed in years.
An ADI must apply a floor of zero to CF‚Çú where the cash flow is negative (i.e.
payable by the ADI to the borrower), which can occur with some derivative
transactions.
41.42. Where an ADI is not able to calculate M for the contracted payments, it
must use a more conservative measure that equals the maximum remaining time
that the borrower is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations
under the terms of the facility agreement, up to a maximum of five years.
42.43. Where amounts have been drawn by a borrower under a committed facility
and the maturity of the drawn amount is less than the maturity of the facility, the
maturity of the facility must be used for determining the capital requirement.
43.44. When determining M for derivatives that are subject to a master netting
agreement, an ADI must use the weighted average maturity of the derivatives. In
this case, the notional amount of each derivative transaction should be used for
the purpose of determining the weighted average maturity.
Exceptions to the one-year maturity floor
44.45. For certain short-term exposures, the one-year floor for maturity may be
replaced by a one-day floor. The maturity of such transactions must be calculated
as the greater of one day and M.
45.46. The one-year floor does not apply to the following exposures:
(a) collateralised capital-market-driven transactions (e.g. OTC derivative
transactions and margin lending) and SFTs with an original maturity of less
than one year, where the relevant documentation contains daily remargining
clauses. The relevant documentation must also require daily revaluation and
include provisions that allow for the prompt liquidation or set-off of
collateral in the event of default or failure to remargin. Where these
transactions are subject to a master netting agreement, the effective maturity
is calculated as the weighted average maturity of the transactions. In this
case, a floor equal to the minimum holding period for the transaction type
as set out in Table 24 of Attachment G to APS 112 will apply.
---
# Treatment of guarantees and credit derivatives { page 31, Attachment B }

46.47. To recognise guarantees and credit derivatives as eligible CRM, an ADI must meet the minimum requirements detailed in Attachment E to this Prudential Standard.

47.48. An ADI may recognise the risk-mitigating effect of guarantees and credit derivatives by applying either a FIRB, AIRB or retail IRB substitution approach. The ADI‚Äôs application of the substitution approaches is constrained in the same manner as a direct exposure to the guarantor or credit protection provider, such that:
- (a) if the ADI applies the FIRB approach to a direct exposure to a guarantor or credit protection provider, it may only recognise the guarantee or credit derivative according to the FIRB substitution approach; and
- (b) if the ADI applies the standardised approach to credit risk to a direct exposure to a guarantor or credit protection provider, it may only recognise the guarantee or credit derivative by applying the standardised approach to the covered portion of the exposure. In this case, the ADI must apply the scope of guarantors and credit protection providers and minimum requirements for the recognition of guarantees and credit derivatives as set out in Attachments I and J to APS 112.

48.49. The application of CRM in the form of guarantees and credit derivatives must not reflect the effect of double default nor result in an adjusted risk weight that is less than that of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor or credit protection provider.

49.50. In calculating the risk weight for the covered portion of the exposure:
- (a) the effective maturity of a corporate, sovereign or financial institution exposure must be the same as the effective maturity of the exposure as if it were not covered;
---
# Recognition under the FIRB substitution approach { page 32, Attachment B }

50.51. The uncovered portion of the exposure must be assigned a risk weight that is calculated in the same manner as a direct exposure to the underlying borrower.

51.52. Where proportional or tranched coverage exists, or where there is a currency or maturity mismatch between the underlying exposure and the guarantee or credit derivative, the approach set out in paragraphs 7 to 15 of Attachment I and paragraphs 14 to 22 of Attachment J to APS 112 must be applied.

# Recognition under the AIRB or retail IRB substitution approach { page 32, Attachment B }

52.53. Under the FIRB substitution approach, an ADI must determine the risk weight of the covered portion of the exposure by using the PD appropriate to the guarantor or credit protection provider‚Äôs borrower grade. The ADI may also replace the LGD of the underlying exposure with the LGD applicable to the guarantee or credit derivative taking into account its seniority and any eligible collateral calculated in accordance with this Attachment.

53.54. Under the AIRB or retail IRB substitution approach, an ADI may recognise the risk-mitigating effect of guarantees and credit derivatives by adjusting either PD or LGD estimates; however, in all cases, only one risk component may be adjusted. Whether adjustments are made through PD or LGD, they must be made in a consistent manner over time and for a given type of guarantee or credit derivative.

# Maturity mismatch { page 32, Attachment B }

54.55. Where a maturity mismatch exists between:
- (a) the residual maturity of the term of lodgement of collateral and the maturity of the exposure covered by the collateral, the ADI must apply the adjustment detailed in paragraph 27 of Attachment G to APS 112;
- (b) the residual maturity of a guarantee and the maturity of the exposure covered by the guarantee, the ADI must apply the adjustment detailed in paragraph 15 of Attachment I to APS 112; or
- (c) the residual maturity of a purchased credit derivative and the maturity of the exposure covered by the derivatives, the ADI must apply the adjustment detailed in paragraph 22 of Attachment J to APS 112.
---
# Treatment of securities financing transactions { page 33, Attachment B }

55.56. For the purpose of calculating RWA and EL amounts for SFTs, including securities lending transactions, an ADI must calculate:
(a) the LGD of the counterparty in accordance with this Attachment;
(b) EAD in accordance with Attachment G to APS 112; and
(c) the capital requirement for the credit risk or market risk inherent in any securities the ADI lends or posts as collateral, if that risk remains with the ADI.
