# Prudential Standard APS 113 - Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-based Approach to Credit Risk { page 1 }

## Objectives and key requirements of this Prudential Standard

This Prudential Standard sets out the requirements that an authorised deposit-taking institution that has, or is seeking, approval to use an internal ratings-based approach to credit risk must meet, both at the time of initial implementation and on an ongoing basis.

The key requirements of this Prudential Standard are that an authorised deposit-taking institution must:

- determine the capital requirement for a given credit exposure, within certain parameters set by APRA;
- develop and maintain rating and risk estimation systems and processes that provide for a meaningful assessment of borrower and transaction characteristics, meaningful differentiation of risk, and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk; and
- ensure that systems and processes for the internal ratings-based approach to determining capital also play an integral role in the institution’s credit approval, risk management and internal capital allocation functions.

The risk components include measures of PD, LGD, EAD and M.

16. An ADI must meet the relevant minimum requirements detailed in this Prudential Standard to use an IRB approach for a given asset class.

17. An ADI must apply a foundation IRB (FIRB), advanced IRB (AIRB), retail IRB or supervisory slotting approach to a given asset class in accordance with its IRB approval and subject to the constraints set out in paragraph 18 of this Prudential Standard. Where the ADI uses the:
(a) FIRB approach, it must provide its own estimates of PD and M, and rely on supervisory estimates for LGD and EAD;
(b) AIRB approach, it must provide its own estimates of PD, LGD (excluding senior unsecured and subordinated corporate exposures for which the ADI must use supervisory LGD estimates) and M, and rely on supervisory estimates for EAD;
---
# Governance and oversight { page 18 }

20. All material aspects of an ADI’s rating and estimation processes must be approved by the ADI’s Board, or relevant Board committee, and senior management. Those parties must possess a general understanding of the ADI’s rating systems and a detailed understanding of the associated management reports. Senior management must notify the Board, or Board committee, of material changes or exceptions from established policies that could have a material impact on the ADI’s rating systems.

21. Senior management must understand the design and operation of an ADI’s rating systems and approve any material differences identified between established procedures and actual practice. Senior management must ensure that the rating systems are operating as intended on an ongoing basis. Senior management and staff in the credit risk control function must meet regularly to discuss the performance of the rating process, areas requiring improvement and the status of efforts to improve previously identified deficiencies.

22. Internal ratings must be an essential part of the reporting to the Board and senior management. Reporting must include:
(a) risk profile by grade;
---
# Credit Risk Control { page 9 }

23. An ADI must have documented policies that detail sound rating system development, validation, implementation, governance and control processes. These policies must:
- (a) be approved and actively discussed by the ADI’s Board or a delegated committee;
- (b) define the roles and responsibilities of parties involved in rating system development, validation, approval and implementation;
- (c) be actively enforced by senior management;
- (d) outline the processes for the development, validation, approval, implementation and governance of all rating and estimation processes. This must include the formation of:
- (i) a register that documents the specification, application, risk classification (materiality) and owner of each rating system;
- (ii) a change log covering all rating system changes; and
- (iii) a centralised issues register that records issues relating to each rating system; and
- (e) outline an ongoing monitoring and validation cycle for each rating system.

# Independent Credit Risk Control Unit { page 9 }

24. An ADI must have an independent credit risk control unit that is responsible for the design or selection, implementation and performance of the ADI’s rating systems. The unit must be functionally independent of the personnel and management functions responsible for originating exposures. Areas of responsibility must include:
- (a) testing and monitoring internal borrower and facility grades, and pools;
- (b) production and analysis of summary reports from the ADI’s rating systems, including historical default data sorted by the rating at the time of default and one year prior to default, migration analysis and monitoring of trends in key rating criteria;
---
# Independent review { page 10 }

27. An ADI’s rating systems and operations must be reviewed at least annually by internal audit or an equally independent function. The review must assess whether the ADI’s development, implementation, validation, governance and control processes are effective and operating as designed. The areas of review must include:

- (a) the operations of the credit risk control function;
- (b) the estimation of PD and, where relevant, LGD and EAD; and
- (c) the ADI’s adherence to all applicable minimum requirements detailed in this Prudential Standard.

The findings of this review must be documented.

# Asset classes { page 10 }

28. For the purpose of deriving the Regulatory Capital requirement under an IRB approach, an ADI must assign its banking book exposures to one of the following IRB asset classes:

- (a) corporate (which includes the four sub-asset classes of specialised lending);
- (b) sovereign;
- (c) financial institution; and
- (d) retail (which consists of four separate sub-asset classes).
---
# Definition of corporate exposures { page 11 }

29. An ADI must ensure that its methodology for assigning credit exposures to different IRB asset classes complies with its IRB approval and is consistent over time.

30. The corporate IRB asset class includes all credit exposures to corporate counterparties and public sector entities, including exposures within the four specialised lending sub-asset classes of project finance, object finance, commodities finance and IPRE. A corporate exposure means a credit obligation of a corporation, partnership, proprietorship or public sector entity, or any other credit exposure that does not meet the criteria of any other defined IRB asset class.

# Income-producing real estate { page 11 }

31. IPRE means a method of providing funding for real estate where the prospects for repayment of the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset or other real estate assets owned by the borrower.

32. In order to treat an exposure as a general corporate exposure rather than IPRE, an ADI must have recourse to a borrower that meets all of the following criteria:
- (a) the borrower is a corporate entity that is managed by a recognised, professional and reputable management team;
- (b) the ADI’s exposure to the borrower is not specifically or substantially financing limited recourse development projects;
- (c) the borrower has greater than $250 million in tangible assets, to which the ADI has unconditional recourse;
- (d) real estate assets are sufficiently diversified such that:
- (i) no single asset represents greater than 25 per cent of the borrower’s real estate portfolio by value; and
- (ii) real estate assets are not concentrated in one particular specific geographic location; and
- (e) for real estate operators or investors, tenants are sufficiently diversified such that no single tenant represents:
- (i) greater than 25 per cent of portfolio net rental income for portfolios of retail shopping centres that typically require significant anchor tenants to attract speciality tenants; and
- (ii) greater than 10 per cent of portfolio net rental income for all other portfolios of real estate assets (e.g. commercial offices, industrial buildings, hotels), with the exception of Government tenants.

# Definition of sovereign exposures { page 12 }

33. The sovereign IRB asset class includes all credit exposures to sovereign counterparties as defined in APS 112.

# Definition of financial institution exposures { page 12 }

34. The financial institution IRB asset class includes all credit exposures to financial institution counterparties. A financial institution means a legal entity whose main business includes: the management of financial assets, lending, factoring, leasing, provision of credit enhancements, securitisation, investments, financial custody, central counterparty services, proprietary trading. APRA may also determine other activities to be financial in nature. Financial institutions include, but are not limited to, banks, securities firms, insurance companies and leveraged funds.

# Definition of retail exposures { page 12 }

35. The retail IRB asset class includes any exposure that:
- (a) is extended to an individual (that is, a natural person) or individuals; and
- (b) forms part of a large pool of exposures that is managed by the ADI on a pooled basis.

Small-business exposures or exposures secured by residential real estate, whether or not extended to an individual, may be classified as retail exposures where they satisfy the criteria in paragraphs 37 or 40 of this Prudential Standard, respectively.

36. An ADI must assign its retail exposures to either the retail residential mortgage, qualifying revolving retail (QRR), small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) retail or other retail sub-asset classes.

# Retail residential mortgage { page 12 }

37. The retail residential mortgage IRB sub-asset class includes exposures that are:
- (a) partly or fully secured by residential real estate;
- (b) managed in a similar manner to other retail exposures; and
- (c) not for business purposes.

# Qualifying revolving retail { page 12 }

38. The QRR IRB sub-asset class includes exposures that satisfy the following criteria:
- (a) the exposures are revolving, unsecured and unconditionally cancellable (both contractually and in practice) by the ADI. Exposures may be considered unconditionally cancellable if the terms of the contract permit the ADI to cancel at any time any existing credit lines or limits provided to a borrower at the ADI’s discretion, and demand immediate repayment for.
---
# Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise Retail { page 13 }

39. QRR exposures must be further split into exposures to transactors and revolvers. For this purpose:
- (a) a QRR transactor is a borrower that has repaid the balance of their facility in full at each scheduled repayment date for the previous 12 months; and
- (b) a QRR revolver is a borrower that does not meet the criteria for treatment as a QRR transactor. An ADI must treat any QRR exposure with less than 12 months of repayment history as an exposure to a QRR revolver.

40. The SME retail IRB sub-asset class includes exposures that meet the following criteria:
- (a) the total business-related exposure of the ADI to a small-business borrower or group of connected borrowers is less than $1.5 million. Small-business exposures extended to, or guaranteed by, an individual are subject to the same exposure threshold. For a subsidiary of the ADI operating in a jurisdiction that applies a different threshold for SME retail, as set by the overseas prudential regulator, the ADI may apply that jurisdiction’s threshold for the calculation of its Level 2 Regulatory Capital requirement for the relevant exposures;
- (b) the reported consolidated annual revenue of a small-business borrower or group of connected borrowers is less than $75 million;
- (c) both the borrower and exposure are non-complex; and
- (d) the ADI treats small-business exposures in its internal risk management systems in the same manner as other retail exposures consistently over time. This requires that such exposures:
- (i) are originated in a similar manner to other retail exposures; and
- (ii) must not be managed individually in a way that is comparable to an exposure in the corporate IRB asset class but rather as part of a portfolio segment or pool of exposures with similar risk characteristics for the purposes of risk assessment and quantification.
---
Other retail { page 14 }

41. The other retail IRB sub-asset class includes all other retail exposures.

# IRB approval { page 14 }

42. APRA may approve an ADI to use an IRB approach for Regulatory Capital purposes. APRA may impose conditions on the ADI’s use of an IRB approach for Regulatory Capital purposes.

43. An ADI must obtain prior approval from APRA to use an IRB approach for Regulatory Capital purposes. Where APRA approves the use of an IRB approach, it will specify how the IRB approach applies in relation to the ADI.

# Initial approval { page 14 }

44. In its initial application to use an IRB approach, an ADI must seek IRB approval for all material asset classes and business units of the ADI. The ADI must demonstrate that it complies with the minimum requirements of this Prudential Standard for the relevant IRB asset classes or sub-asset classes, and has been using rating systems and risk components that are broadly in line with the requirements of this Prudential Standard for at least three years prior to an IRB approval being given.⁴

45. In its initial application to use an IRB approach, an ADI must, unless determined otherwise by APRA, also seek approval to use an internal risk measurement model for the purpose of determining the Regulatory Capital requirement for interest rate risk in the banking book as set out in Prudential Standard APS 117 Capital Adequacy: Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book.

46. In addition to credit exposures for which an ADI must use the standardised approach to credit risk, APRA may permit the ADI to use a combination of an IRB approach and the standardised approach for Regulatory Capital purposes. This approach is referred to as ‘partial use’. Partial use may apply on a temporary or permanent basis.

47. An ADI seeking approval to adopt partial use must provide APRA with information on any business activities for which the ADI proposes to use the standardised approach to credit risk. This information must be provided both at the time of the ADI’s initial application for the use of an IRB approach and subsequent to the ADI obtaining IRB approval.

# Phased roll-out { page 14 }

48. Where it is not practical for an ADI to implement an IRB approach across all material asset classes and business units at the same time, APRA may approve a. Improvements to an ADI’s rating systems or risk components will not render it non-compliant with this three-year requirement.

A phased roll-out is where the ADI, in accordance with a specified timetable:
- (a) adopts an IRB approach across asset classes within a particular business unit;
- (b) adopts an IRB approach across business units in the Level 2 group;
- (c) moves from the FIRB approach to the AIRB approach, where the use of the AIRB approach is permitted; and
- (d) moves from the supervisory slotting approach to the FIRB or AIRB approach for IPRE.

However, where the ADI adopts an IRB approach for an asset class or sub-asset class within a particular business unit, it must apply that IRB approach to all exposures in that asset class or sub-asset class within that business unit.

49. An ADI that has received approval to adopt a phased roll-out of an IRB approach must have an implementation plan in place that specifies the extent and timing of roll-out of the IRB approach across all significant asset classes or sub-asset classes and business units.

50. During the roll-out period:
- (a) a significant portion (at APRA’s discretion) of any expected Regulatory Capital benefit from initial IRB approval may only become available after obtaining final approval. APRA may vary this percentage during the period from initial to final approval to reflect APRA’s assessment of the ADI’s ability to progress to final approval; and
- (b) no capital relief will be granted for intra-group transactions that reduce an ADI’s aggregate capital requirement by transferring credit risk among entities on the standardised approach to credit risk, FIRB approach and AIRB approach. This includes, but is not limited to, asset sales and cross-guarantees.

# Permanent Partial Use { page 15 }

51. APRA will approve permanent partial use of an IRB approach only in exceptional circumstances. An ADI seeking such approval must be able to demonstrate that the relevant business activities to which an IRB approach does not apply are immaterial in terms of size and perceived risk profile.

# Ongoing Requirements { page 15 }

52. An ADI that has obtained IRB approval must seek prior approval from APRA where it intends to make:
- (a) changes to its rating systems that will result in a material change in RWA for a given type of exposure; or

(b)  a significant change to its modelling assumptions.
53.   An ADI that has obtained IRB approval must continue to employ that IRB approach on an ongoing basis except to the extent that the IRB approval is revoked or suspended for some or all of the ADI’s operations. A return to the standardised approach to credit risk, or the use of the FIRB approach where the ADI has approval to use the AIRB approach, will generally only be permitted in exceptional circumstances.
54.   APRA may, at any time, vary or revoke an IRB approval, or impose additional conditions on the IRB approval if it considers that:
(a)  an ADI is not complying with this Prudential Standard; or
(b)  it is appropriate, having regard to the particular circumstances of the ADI.
Where APRA has varied or revoked an IRB approval, it may require the ADI to apply the standardised approach to credit risk for some or all of its operations, until it meets the conditions specified by APRA for returning to an IRB approach.
55.   APRA may require an ADI to reduce its level of credit risk or increase its capital if APRA considers that the ADI’s capital for credit risk under an IRB approach is not commensurate with its credit risk profile.
56.   If an ADI becomes aware that it is not complying with a requirement of this Prudential Standard, it must notify APRA and provide a plan for its timely return to compliance.
