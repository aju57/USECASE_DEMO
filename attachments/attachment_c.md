## Calculation of expected loss
1. An ADI must separately calculate, for non-defaulted and defaulted exposures, the total EL amount aggregated across the corporate, sovereign, financial institution and retail IRB asset classes. Other than for specialised lending exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach, the EL amount must be calculated as follows:
- (a) for non-defaulted exposures, the product of PD, LGD and EAD;
- (b) for defaulted exposures under the AIRB or retail IRB approach, the ADI’s best estimate of EL given current economic circumstances and the facility’s status;⁷ and
- (c) for defaulted exposures under the FIRB approach, the product of the relevant supervisory estimates of LGD and EAD.

## Expected loss for specialised lending exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach
2. For specialised lending exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach, the EL amount must be calculated by multiplying EAD by the relevant factor specified in Table 8.

| Table 8 | EL under the supervisory slotting approach |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| | Strong | Good | Satisfactory | Weak | Default |
| Specialised| 0.4% | 0.8% | 2.8% | 8% | 50% |
| lending | | | | | |

# Calculation of eligible provisions { page 34, Attachment C }
3. For exposures in the IRB asset classes, total eligible provisions associated with those exposures are:
- (a) credit related provisions (e.g. any provisions for non-defaulted or defaulted exposures). Any amount included in an ADI’s provisions for non-defaulted exposures may only be used as eligible provisions to offset EL for non-defaulted exposures;
- (b) partial write-offs; and
7 Refer to paragraph 102 of Attachment D to this Prudential Standard.



4. Where an ADI uses the standardised approach to credit risk for a portion of its exposures, it must attribute total provisions on a pro rata basis according to the proportion of RWA subject to the standardised and IRB approaches.

5. Where the standardised approach to credit risk is used exclusively by an entity within the Level 2 group, all of the provisions booked within that entity must be attributed to the standardised approach.

6. Provisions that are booked by entities within the Level 2 group that exclusively use an IRB approach to credit risk qualify as eligible provisions under paragraph 3 of this Attachment.

# Treatment of expected loss and provisions { page 35, Attachment C }

7. An ADI must separately compare the total EL amount for defaulted exposures and non-defaulted exposures with total eligible provisions associated with the relevant exposures.

8. Where the total EL amount is higher than total eligible provisions for the relevant exposures, the difference must be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as detailed in APS 111.

9. For non-defaulted exposures, where the total EL amount is lower than eligible provisions associated with these exposures, the difference may be included in Tier 2 Capital up to a maximum of 0.6 per cent of credit RWA calculated under the IRB approach as detailed in APS 111.
