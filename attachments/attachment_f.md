# Attachment F - Risk-weighted assets for purchased receivables { page 59, Attachment F }

1. An ADI must treat purchased receivables as either:
- (a) retail receivables, where the underlying receivables meet the definition of retail exposures; or
- (b) corporate receivables, where the underlying receivables meet the definition of corporate exposures.

## Risk-weighted assets for default risk

2. When estimating PD and LGD for purchased retail receivables or purchased corporate receivables, an ADI may utilise internal or external reference data. The estimates must be determined on a stand-alone basis without regard to any assumption of recourse of guarantees from the seller or other parties.

# Default risk for purchased retail receivables { page 59, Attachment F }

3. An ADI must calculate the capital requirement for default risk for purchased retail receivables using the relevant retail risk-weight function in accordance with Attachment A to this Prudential Standard.

4. For hybrid pools containing receivables belonging to more than one retail sub-asset class, if a purchasing ADI cannot separate the exposures by the type of retail sub-asset class, the risk-weight function that produces the highest capital requirement at each PD level must be applied.

# Default risk for purchased corporate receivables { page 59, Attachment F }

5. An ADI must calculate the capital requirement for default risk for purchased corporate receivables using the corporate risk-weight function as set out in Attachment A to this Prudential Standard. The ADI must assess the default risk of individual corporate borrowers within each pool of purchased corporate receivables as detailed in Attachment D to this Prudential Standard.

## Top-down approach

6. Where an ADI is unable to calculate the capital requirement for default risk for purchased corporate receivables as detailed in paragraph 5 of this Attachment, the ADI may use a top-down approach for purchased corporate receivables. The use of a top-down approach is subject to prior approval from APRA.

7. To be eligible for the top-down approach, purchased corporate receivables must satisfy the following conditions:
- (a) the receivables are purchased from unrelated, third-party sellers (i.e. an ADI has not been directly or indirectly involved in originating the receivables);


(b) the receivables have been generated on an arms-length basis between the seller and the obligors. Inter-company accounts receivable and receivables subject to contra-accounts between firms that buy and sell amongst each other are ineligible;¹³

(c) the purchasing ADI has a claim on all proceeds from the pool of receivables or a pro rata interest in the proceeds commensurate with its exposure to the pool;¹⁴ and

(d) the maximum size of an individual exposure in the pool of receivables is less than $100,000.

8. The existence of full or partial recourse to the seller does not automatically disqualify an ADI from adopting a top-down approach provided the cash flows from the purchased corporate receivables are the primary source of ultimate repayment.

9. Under the top-down approach, an ADI must segment pools of purchased corporate receivables into homogenous buckets. The risk weight for default risk must be determined using the risk-weight function for corporate exposures as detailed in Attachment A to this Prudential Standard.¹⁵

10. An ADI must estimate PD and LGD for each of the homogenous segmented pools of purchased corporate receivables in accordance with its IRB approval for corporate exposures. The ADI must also calculate:

(a) EAD as the amount outstanding for each segmented pool less the capital requirement for dilution risk for each segmented pool prior to CRM or, for a revolving purchase facility, the sum of the current amount of receivables purchased plus 40 per cent of any undrawn purchase commitments less the capital requirement for dilution risk prior to CRM; and

(b) M for drawn amounts as equal to the segmented pools’ exposure-weighted average maturity. This same value of M must also be used for any undrawn amounts to which the ADI is committed under a purchased receivables facility, provided that the facility contains covenants, early amortisation triggers or other features that protect the purchasing ADI against a significant deterioration in the quality of the future receivables it is required to purchase over the facility’s term. In the absence of such protection, the M for undrawn amounts must be calculated as the sum of:

13 Contra-accounts involve a customer buying from and selling to the same firm.
14 Claims on tranches of the proceeds (e.g. first or second loss positions) are subject to the capital requirements set out in APS 120.
15 The firm-size adjustment, as set out in paragraph 6 of Attachment A to this Prudential Standard, is the weighted average firm-size for individual exposures in the pool of purchased corporate receivables. If an ADI does not have the information to calculate the average firm-size of the pool, the firm-size adjustment does not apply.

11. Unless a purchasing ADI can demonstrate to APRA that dilution risk is immaterial, it must hold capital for dilution risk for purchased corporate and retail receivables.

12. An ADI must calculate the capital requirement for dilution risk for purchased receivables, at either the level of the segmented pool or the individual receivables making up a pool, using the corporate risk-weight function. PD must be set equal to the estimate of the expected long-run average annual loss rate (expressed as a percentage of the exposure amount, i.e. the total EAD owed to the ADI by all obligors in the relevant pool of receivables) and LGD must be set to 100 per cent.

13. An ADI may utilise internal or external reference data to estimate an expected long-run average annual loss rate for dilution risk. These estimates must be calculated on a stand-alone basis without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.

14. An appropriate maturity must be used when determining the capital requirement for dilution risk. If an ADI can demonstrate to APRA that dilution risk is appropriately monitored and managed so as to be resolved within one year of acquisition of the purchased receivables, APRA may grant an approval allowing the ADI to base its calculations on a one-year maturity assumption.

# Treatment of purchase price discount for receivables { page 61, Attachment F }

15. Where a portion of any purchase price discount is refundable to the seller, the refundable amount must be treated as first-loss protection under APS 120. Non-refundable purchase price discounts for purchased receivables do not affect the Regulatory Capital calculation.

16. When collateral or partial guarantees obtained on purchased receivables provide first-loss protection covering default losses, dilution losses, or both, they must be recognised as first-loss protection under APS 120.

# Recognition of credit risk mitigation { page 61, Attachment F }

17. An ADI may recognise a guarantee for purchased receivables where the guarantee meets the requirements in Attachment E to this Prudential Standard. If the guarantee covers:
(a) a pool’s default risk and dilution risk, the ADI may substitute the risk weight for an exposure to the guarantor in place of the relevant pool’s total risk weight for default and dilution risks;

# Requirements specific to estimating probability of default, loss given default and expected loss for qualifying purchased receivables { page 62, Attachment F }

18. The minimum requirements for risk quantification detailed in paragraphs 19 to 21 of this Attachment must be satisfied in order to apply the top-down approach for:

(a) default risk (in relation to purchased corporate receivables); or
(b) dilution risk (in relation to purchased corporate or retail receivables).

19. An ADI must group purchased receivables into sufficiently homogeneous segmented pools so that accurate and consistent estimates of PD and LGD for default risk and expected long-run average loss rates for dilution risk can be determined.

20. The risk-bucketing process applied by an ADI must reflect the seller’s underwriting practices and heterogeneity of its customers. Methods and data for estimating PD, LGD and expected long-run average loss rates must comply with the risk quantification standards for retail exposures detailed in Attachment D to this Prudential Standard.

21. To qualify for the top-down approach for default risk, the pools of receivables and overall lending relationship must be closely monitored and controlled by an ADI.
